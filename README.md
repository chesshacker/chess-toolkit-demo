# Sample Chess API

This small program is meant to demonstrate the
[Chess Toolkit](https://github.com/steveortiz/chess_toolkit)
in a small Ruby on Rails application.

## Developing

Docker should get you most of the way there. Run the following commands
and then connect your web browser to http://0.0.0.0:3000/

```sh
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
